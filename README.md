# Self-Balancing-Cube
UPDATE 5th Feb 2025

PCB Details and updated firmware for Self Balancing Cube developed by RemRC https://github.com/remrc/Self-Balancing-Cube or his youtube page https://www.youtube.com/@ReMRC/videos

**Note** : There are several versions of the wiring diagram for the Nidec 24H motors showing different colours for the wiring, **ignore the colours** the important thing is the pinout this is the correct pin out for the motors I got from Aliexpress (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007830157138.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.16.43d91802D3UhH8)
